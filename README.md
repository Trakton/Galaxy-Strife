# GalaxyWar
Galaxy War is a game i made during my second year of high school. I was studying Game Programming and i got very excited about how interesting it would be to apply complex algorithms and data structes in a game design enviroment, aiming to create interesting artificial intelligence and different cool behaviors for the NPCs of a game.
