# Galaxy War

Galaxy War is a game i made during my second year of high school. I was studying Game Programming and i've got very excited about how interesting it would be to apply complex algorithms and data structures in a game design enviroment, aiming to create interesting artificial intelligence and different cool behaviors for the NPCs of a game. Personally,i love complex particle effects visuals in a game, and by playing hours and hours of Geometry Wars, i've made a challenge for myself to code something similar, and to do my best to understand how such spectacular games are developed in real life.

The game is public for anyone who shares the same passion as i do, and for any student trying to understand how to code a game, and how those particle effects can be set up in Unity! The game is your's! Just get it, learn from it, and have fun with it!
